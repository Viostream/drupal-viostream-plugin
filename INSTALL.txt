INTRODUCTION
------------
The Viostream module provides a field formatter to embed Viostream videos
directly into your Drupal or GovCMS website. It works with standard Drupal Link
and Text fields, making it easy to add video content from your Viostream account.

Key features:
 * Works with Link, String, and String Long field types
 * Customizable player dimensions and behavior
 * Responsive video player with 16:9 aspect ratio option
 * Support for multiple Viostream URL formats
 * Configurable autoplay, mute, and control options

 * Drupal 8.9 or higher (compatible with Drupal 9, 10, and 11)
 * Field module (Drupal core)
 * Link module (Drupal core)


INSTALLATION
------------
1. Install the module using Composer (recommended):
   
   composer require viostream/govcms-viostream-plugin

   Or download and place the module in your modules directory:

2. Enable the module:
   
   Via Drush:
   drush en viostream
   
   Or via the Drupal admin interface:

   Admin → Structure → Content types → [Type] → Manage display
   
3. Click the settings icon to configure player options:
   - Width: Player width (e.g., 100%, 640px)
   - Height: Player height (e.g., 400)
   - Responsive: Enable for 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Autoplay: Auto-start video playback
   - Muted: Mute video by default
   - Show controls: Display player controls


USAGE
-----
After configuration, add videos to your content:

1. Create or edit content with the configured field
2. Enter a Viostream video URL or ID:
   - https://play.viostream.com/VIDEO_ID
   - https://viostream.com/video/VIDEO_ID
   - https://app.viostream.com/video/VIDEO_ID
   - VIDEO_ID (direct ID)
3. Save and view your content

The video will be embedded using your configured settings.
